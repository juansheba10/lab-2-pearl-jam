            <h3>Why Pearl Jam?</h3>
            <p class="text">We was originally named Mookie Blaylock, after a professional basketball player, but settled on the words pearl and jam separately—the latter reportedly after seeing musician Neil Young in concert and admiring his “jam session” style. </p>

        <div class="container">
            <h3>When we explode!</h3>
            <p class="text">The band released its first album, Ten, in 1991. Alternative rock had already begun to receive mainstream acceptance nd Ten (featuring the major hits “Jeremy,” “Evenflow,” and “Alive”) became a multimillion-seller. The group also earned a reputation for resisting the mainstream music industry</p>

            <h3>Battle against TicketMaster</h3>
            <p class="text">By 1994, Pearl Jam was "fighting on all fronts", as its manager described the band at the time. Reporter Chuck Philips broke a series of stories showing that Ticketmaster was gouging Pearl Jam's customers. Pearl Jam was outraged when, after it played a pair of charity benefit shows in Chicago, Illinois, it discovered that ticket vendor Ticketmaster had added a service charge to the tickets. </p>

        <div class="container">
            <h3>2000´s and moving forward</h3>
            <p class="text">Pearl Jam, however, remained a popular concert draw, and its 2000 European tour was chronicled on 25 live and unedited CDs. The politically charged Riot Act (2002) was a solid rock album, but its intensity did not approach the eponymous Pearl Jam (2006). Critics and fans embraced the return to the arena-rock sound of Vs, and singles like “World Wide Suicide” recalled the anger and urgency of “Jeremy.”</p>
